# Shopping cart experience 
This is a project I did as a Monday evening fun. Idea was to create React experience in pure JavaScript without any library.

Live demo -> updating soon..

Features
- Generates a dynamic list from an array
- User can add each item to the cart
- User can remove items from the cart
- User can see the total price of all the items in the cart
